## Control and Supervision System for Humidity in Plant Greenhouses Based on Arduino
This was the final paper for my Bachelor of Science Degree in **Mechatronics Engineering**.
This is a prototype designed to measure and control the humidity in a plant's greenhouse.
It uses an **Arduino**, programmed in **C**, and has an **HTML web server** for remote access and manual control.
The prototype was functional, but because the greenhouse was open on one of the sides, it spent too much water to achieve the desired humidity.
So it was shut off after some time.

- C, HTML, Arduino, IÂ²C, HTTP.
- Embedded Engineering, Controls engineering, Web development.
